# mqtt_OPNsense_cpu_temperature

Takes the temperature of the CPU in an OPNsense router and sends it to an MQTT server,

Because it is based on FreeBSD should also be working for PfSense ðŸ˜€

It checks only the temperature of core zero, you can tune how many cores it checks and whether it averages them or gets the maximum. Honestly I have seen that setting it only for one core is enough cuz they are usually utilized equally.


Run ./pip_dependences.sh to install the python3 dependences
